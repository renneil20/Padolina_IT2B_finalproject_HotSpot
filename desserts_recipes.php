                <h3>Yakgwa (약과; 藥菓)</h3>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>For Dough:</strong></p><br>
                    <em>1.</em> 3 cup all-purpose flour (medium-protein flour)<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 1/3 cup sesame oil<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 1/3 cup soju<br>
                    <em>4.</em> 1/3 cup honey<br>
                    <em>5.</em> 1/4 cup chopped pine nuts<br>
                    <em>6.</em> 1/4 tsp salt (optional – original recipe omits salt)</p>

                <p><strong>For Syrup:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> 1 cup rice syrup (jochung 조청 – if not available, you can substitute honey)<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 1 cup honey<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 2 cup water<br>
                    <em>4.</em> 1 Tbsp ginger (grated, 1 -2 tsp ginger powder is OK too)</p>

                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Prepare oil for frying. Note for Yakgwa, we want to start frying at a low temperature.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Make syrup by mixing rice syrup, honey, and water in a saucepan or frying pan. Heat on medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once it boils, turn the heat off and add the chopped ginger, mix and set it aside.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> In a large mixing bowl, add flour (add salt – optional) and then sesame oil. Mix the flour with the oil by rubbing the mixture thoroughly with your hands, until you feel the oil is all blended in with the flour.<br>
                    <em>4.</em> Mix the Soju and honey in a separate cup/bowl until the honey is all dissolved.<br>
                    <em>5.</em> Pour the soju/honey mixture into the flour mixture and gently press the dough to form a ball.<br>
                    <em>6.</em> Divide the dough in half. Roll out one-half of the dough into a 1/4 to 1/3 inch thick rectangular shape. Cut the dough into 1 inch wide strips and then cut the strips at an angle to make diamond shapes.<br>
                    <em>7.</em> Yakgwa is fried in 2 different temperatures and this is what makes it tricky. For the first part, oil should be around 265° F (130°C). Yakwa will slowly rise to the top.<br>
                    <em>8.</em> For the second part, when all the pieces have risen to the top, raise the heat to medium-high to reach normal frying temperature. Continue frying until Yakgwa turns rich brown in color.<br>
                    <em>9.</em> When Yakgwa pieces turn rich dark brown, remove them from the oil and let the oil drain in a colander lined with a paper towel.<br>
                    <em>10.</em> Soak fried Yakgwa in prepared ginger honey syrup.<br>
                    <em>11.</em> Leave for a few min until it has soaked up all the syrup, take it out of the syrup and place it onto a plate.<br>
                    <em>12.</em> Sprinkle top with chopped pine nuts while it is still wet so the nuts will stick to it.</p>

                <h3>SONGPYEON (RICE CAKES)</h3>
                <p><strong>Ingredients: <br>
                    Rice Powder (ssalgaru)</strong><br>
                        <em>1.</em> 2 cups wet rice powder per batch (about 16 songpyeon)<br>
                        <em>2.</em> 4 to 5 ounces pine needles<br>
                        <em>3.</em> 1 teaspoon sesame oil</p>

                <p><strong>Pink dough:</strong><br>
                        <em>1.</em> 2 cups frozen rice powder<br>
                        <em>2.</em> 4 tablespoons raspberry juice</p>

                <p><strong>Filling: </strong><br>
                        <em>1.</em> ⅓ cup roasted sesame seeds<br>
                        <em>2.</em> 1.5 tablespoons sugar<br>
                        <em>3.</em> 1 tablespoon honey<br>
                        <em>4.</em> pinch salt</p>

                <p><strong>Instructions: Dough</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> For each type of dough, sift the rice powder into a bowl. Prepare the flavoring and liquid ingredients (water/juice/mugwort powder/kabocha) for each selected color of dough. Add the specified amount of the solid and/or liquid (making sure it’s boiling hot) to the rice powder, quickly stirring them in with a spoon. (Tip: Hold a teaspoon or two of the liquid and make sure more liquid is needed before adding it.)<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Knead, pressing and stretching with the heel of the hand. Fold and rotate the dough. Repeat the kneading process for 4 to 5 minutes. (If the dough sticks to your hands or the bowl after some kneading, it’s too wet. Add more rice powder in 1 tablespoon increments. If the dough breaks easily or is too stiff, it’s too dry. Add more boiling hot water in 1 teaspoon increments.)<br>
                    <em>3.</em> Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

                <p><strong>Filling:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Roughly grind the sesame seeds in a grinder or blender. Add the sugar, honey and pinch of salt. Mix everything well together until the sugar and honey are evenly distributed.</p>

                <p><strong>Assemble:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> To assemble, tear off a small piece of the dough enough to make roughly 1-inch ball. Roll tightly between your palms to shape a ball.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Make a well in the ball by pressing into it with your thumb, and press outwards, with both of your thumbs, on the inside walls of the well to slightly expand the opening.><br>
                    <em>3.</em> Place 1/2 teaspoon of the filling in the well. Seal tightly by squeezing the edges together. Squeeze the whole rice cake lightly in your palm to firm it up, and then gently roll between your palms to smooth out the surface. Shape it into a nice crescent shape. Pinch along to create a wing. Repeat until all the dough/filling is used.</p>

                <p><strong>Steam and finish:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Boil water in a steamer. Place a thin layer of pine needles or a silicon liner or damp kitchen cloth in the steamer insert. Boil the water over high heat. When it starts to steam, place the rice cakes in the steamer insert without the pieces touching one another. Cover with a thin layer of pine needles, if available. Cover and steam for about 20 minutes.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Prepare a big bowl of cold water. Using a long-handed spoon or tong, remove the rice cakes from the steamer. Drop them in the cold water for a quick rinse, removing all the pine needles if used. Transfer the rice cakes to a colander to drain. Lightly coat your hands with the sesame oil and rub the oil on the rice cakes in batches. Serve warm or at room temperature</p>

                <h3>Yaksik (Sweet Rice with Dried Fruits and Nuts)</h3>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> 2 cups sweet rice (aka glutinous rice), chapssal (찹쌀) Standard measuring cup before soaking<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 4 ounces peeled fresh, frozen, or canned chestnuts - about 12 to 15 whole chestnuts depending on the sizes ½ to ¾ cup cut pieces<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 2.5 ounces jujubes (daechu, 대추) - about 10 to 15 depending on sizes ½ cup, packed, cut pieces<br>
                    <em>4.</em> 1 tablespoon pine nuts - optional<br>
                    <em>5.</em> 1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds - optional</p>

                <p><strong>Seasonings:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 1/2 cup dark brown sugar use ⅓ cup for less sweet yaksik<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 2 tablespoons honey or use about 2 to 2.5 tablespoons more brown sugar<br>
                    <em>4.</em> 2 tablespoons sesame oil<br>
                    <em>5.</em> 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder - optional</p>

                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Rinse the sweet rice 3 or 4 times until the water is fairly clear. Soak the rice for an hour or up to 2 hours. Drain well while preparing the other ingredients. Tap the strainer to shake off any excess water.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Meanwhile, rinse the jujubes. Cut around the seed of each jujube to separate the flesh, and then cut the flesh into small pieces. Reserve the seeds to make jujube water.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> To make jujube flower decorations, roll the flesh tightly, and cut into thin slices.<br>
                    <em>4.</em>In a small saucepan, boil 3 cups of water and the jujube seeds over medium high heat until the liquid is reduced to 1.5 cup (15 to 20 minutes). Measure this for the accurate ratio of rice and water.<br>
                    <em>5.</em> To 1.5 cup of jujube flavored water, add the soy sauce, sugar, and honey. Bring it to a boil and continue to boil for a minute, which will yield about 1 and 3/4 cups of seasoned water. Add the sesame oil.</p>
