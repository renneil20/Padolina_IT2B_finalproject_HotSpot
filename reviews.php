            <h3>Heeseung</h3>
            <p>Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us! I have always loved yaksik and never made it until today. Your directions were beautiful and the taste was delicious! My mom was very impressedâ€”she told me about how her mom used cheesecloth to make it when she was a child. The InstantPot made this a snap, I canâ€™t wait to make another batch! I didnâ€™t have jujube so I substituted chopped dates, which worked just fine.</p>

            <h3>Ethan Batumbakal</h3>
            <p>Koreans are the masters of fried chicken! I know because I live in Korea! Definitely add the gochujang (Korean chili paste) for a truly unique and authentic Korean flavor.</p>
            <p>Your website is perfect for people who don't want to cook.</p>
